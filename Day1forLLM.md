### Frontier Models
Which are basically models at the forefront of what's possible. 
In day 1 we are going to set up our environment and build our solution from there.

### Notes 

A .env file -> which is a common way to store secrets in a way that you can access in your project, tht don't get chucked into source code control

## Frontier Models:
They have been trained in a particular way where they expect two different types of instructions from the user.

### The System Prompt
This is something which explains the context of this conversation. It tells them what kind of tasks they're performing, their tone, etc

- How do we change the system prompt? What kinda info can we use in the system prompt?
### The user prompt
This is the conversational starter.

The role of the large language model, is to figure out what is the most likely way to respond given this user prompt.
Like if it is given a user prompt with the context in the system prompt, how should the next text coming from the agent be...
