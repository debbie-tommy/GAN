# Notes
- OLLAMA - is a platform that lets you run c++ code version of LLMs (compiled) directly on your machine. It's called Ollama because it was originally built on a model called Llama (open source version for meta)

  #### Step 1 - Download Ollama
  Once downloaded, go to Powershell and type 'ollama run llama3.2' so ollama run and then the model you want to run
  #### Language Learning Bot 
  This is actually a paid commercial product on an existing app, but here we have built it for free using Open Source. 
  #### Takeaway: qwen2.5 is actually better for learning languages

  ### My Motivation:
  To build projects that solve real world commercial problems.
